        </p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>
          A valid credit card must be received at the time of order. If a valid

          agreed to and extended by contract prior to the time of order.
        </p>
        <p>
          MapScans will bill Your credit card upon completion of Services for
          all charges and Services unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior
          to the completion of your order. After services are completed, your
          credit card may be charged again if you have incurred additional fees
          due to circumstances including but not limited to cancellation,
          reshoots, travel fees, ‘no show’ fees and/or upgrades to your chosen
          services elected after the initial order was placed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices listed on the Site are for residential properties only.
          Commercial properties are subject to different pricing. Contact

        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that MapScans must pursue legal action in order to
          collect on balances due, You agree to reimburse MapScans for all
          expenses incurred to recover any and all sums due, including but not
          limited to all attorney’s fees and other expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          MapScans bills You through an online account (Your “Billing Account”)
          for use of the Service. You agree to pay MapScans all charges at the
          prices then in effect for any use of the Service by You or other
          persons (including Your agents) using Your Billing Account, and You
          authorize MapScans to charge Your chosen payment provider (Your
          “Payment Method”) for the Service. You agree to make payment using
          that selected Payment Method. MapScans reserves the right to correct
          any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested
          or received payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms of Your payment will be based on Your Payment Method and may
          be determined by agreements between You and the financial institution,
          credit card issuer or other provider of Your chosen Payment Method
          (the “Payment Method Provider”). If MapScans does not receive payment
          from Your Payment Method Provider, You agree to pay all amounts due on
          Your Billing Account upon demand.
        </p>
        <p>

          circumstances bill your credit card for charges that you do not
          authorize, however, by keeping your credit card on file with MapScans
          by providing such information at www.MapScans.com, you grant MapScans
          the right to bill your credit card directly for Services that you ask
          MapScans to perform. MapScans keeps your information secure and will
          not under any circumstances allow for the unlawful or unauthorized use
          of your credit card information. MapScans is not responsible, however,
          for malicious attacks or theft that result in credit card information
          being transferred to another party without the consent of MapScans,
          unless such illegal acts shall occur as a result of negligence by
          MapScans.
        </p>
        <h2>Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
          After your order is placed, an MapScans representative will contact
          you either via telephone or email in order to schedule Your photo
          shoot. MapScans is not liable in any way if MapScans cannot get in
          touch with You in the event that You provided inaccurate contact
          information during the registration process or if you are unavailable
          or for any other reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          If neither agent nor homeowner is present at the time the Services are
          scheduled to be performed, and the agent nor homeowner has made prior
          requests related to shot selection, all shots taken will be at the
          discretion of the photographer. It is always the homeowner’s and/or
          agent’s responsibility to prepare the property for the photo shoot,
          and MapScans is not responsible for homes that are not in
          ‘show-quality’ condition at the time of the photo shoot. MapScans
          shoots all photos of the property in “as-is” condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless access to the property is otherwise arranged, the agent or
          homeowner must be present at the time of the tour. MapScans is not
          responsible for inaccessible properties and reserves the right to
          charge cancellation, reschedule, reshoot, or travel fees as a result
          of property inaccessibility.
        </p>
        <h2>Distribution of Services and Products</h2>
        <p>
          After a shoot is completed and the photos are processed, the photos
          and tours will be uploaded to the MapScans website. An email
          containing a link to the photos and Services will be sent to the
          contact on file. MapScans is not responsible for emails not received,
          but will make any attempt to rectify this situation by sending emails
          to the appropriate party once notified that the initial email was not
          received.
        </p>
        <p>
          No refunds will be given in the event that a listing sells between the
          time the photos are taken and the time they are distributed to the
          agent and/or property owner.
        </p>
        <h2>Internet Distribution and Display</h2>
        <p>
          All clients understand and agree that all photos displayed on the
          internet are the property of MapScans. Moreover, all properties that
          are photographed and uploaded to the internet may be available for
          public viewing. In the event that an agent or homeowner’s contact
          information is attached to these listings, it may be displayed online
          for public viewing.
        </p>
        <p>
          MapScans reserves the right to send your property information and
          photos to other real estate websites and portals in order to generate
          more exposure for your listings. If you do not wish for such
          distribution, you must request that we do not send your listing data
          to any third parties.
        </p>
        <h2>Additional Fees</h2>
        <p>
          MapScans reserves the right to charge additional fees due to
          cancellations, rescheduling, travel time, and reshoots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellations or Rescheduling will be honored for a full refund up to
          5:00 MST the day prior to the scheduled shoot. Any cancellations due
          to weather except for extreme circumstances, at the discretion of
          MapScans, may result in a cancellation/rescheduling fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a MapScans photographer has photographed a home,
          cancellations/reschedulings will not result in a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travel Fees may be charged if properties are outside of MapScans’s
          Service Area. Please See the Service Area map found at MapScans.com
          for detailed maps of our Service Area. In the event that a travel fee
          is charged, the fee will be disclosed to You no later than when the
          shoot is scheduled.
