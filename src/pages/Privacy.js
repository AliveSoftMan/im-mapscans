        <h1>Use of cookies and web beacons</h1>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored in a browser-related
          file on your computer’s hard drive when you use the Services on the
          Site. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and are read by
          a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Our primary
          use of cookies is to enable us to recognize your computer each time
          you return to our Site or use our Service, keep track of your
          preferences, determine what you have already seen on our Site and to
          improve your online experience. For example, storing a cookie on your
          computer allows you to login without typing your registered email
          address and password. We may also use an e-mail delivery and marketing
          company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and
          cookies are used in those e-mail messages to help us measure the
          effectiveness of our advertising. Third parties, including third-party
          advertisers, may also set cookies. Such third parties are responsible
          for placing and using such cookies and may collect information about
          you through such cookies. We do not have access to such cookies,
          control the use of such cookies or have control over the privacy
          policies of such parties. Please also note that certain types of
          emails available through the Services on our Site may automatically
          log you into the Site and/or set new cookies when you click on the
          links in the e-mails and that you may need to manually remove such
          cookies if you do not want them to be set on your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not want cookies stored on your computer you can reject
          cookies by modifying your web browser setting accordingly (each
          browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to
          learn how to change your cookie preferences). However, if you choose
          to reject cookies, you may not be able to access products and services
          that we offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to cookies, MapScans logs standard information such as
          your IP address along with the URL from which you came to our Site and
          the URLs visited on our Site, which may or may not contain some
          personally identifiable information. IP addresses are used by your
          computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address
          is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your
          computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server
          as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so
          that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.
          MapScans will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your
          personal information. Other “traffic data” includes time, the type of
          web browser being used, the operating system, and CPU speed. This
          information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are
          connected to a web site.
        </p>
        <h1>Protection of collected information</h1>
        <p>
          MapScans uses security systems and secure servers to protect your
          information. For example, your personal information is
          password-protected so that only you may access or change the
          information. You should not share your password with anyone. MapScans
          personnel will never ask you to divulge your password in written or
          electronic communications. We will only ask you for your password when
          you contact us and only in cases where you request customer service to
          correct a service problem which requires your password. Additionally,
          MapScans uses Inspire Commerce, a third party, to process all credit
          card payments. Please visit Inspire Commerce’s website at
          www.inspirecommerce.com to read Inspire Commerce’s privacy policy with
          respect to personal information you provide to Inspire Commerce’s for
          any payments to MapScans. Please be aware that while MapScans protects
          your personal information to the greatest extent possible, Internet
          security technology changes rapidly and data transmission is never
          100% secure. We cannot guarantee that any safeguards we use will
          completely protect your information from security threats whether now
          or in the future. You should also be aware that despite our efforts,
          factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of your
          information. Accordingly, we are not able to guarantee the security of
          the information you transmit when utilizing our Services, and as such,
          you use the Site at your own risk.
